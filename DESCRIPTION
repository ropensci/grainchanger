Description: Data aggregation via moving window or direct methods. Aggregate a 
    fine-resolution raster to a grid. The moving window method smooths the surface 
    using a specified function within a moving window of a specified size and shape 
    prior to aggregation. The direct method simply aggregates to the grid using the 
    specified function.
